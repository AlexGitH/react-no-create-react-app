# React without create-react-app

It's an example of minimal workable version of react app without `create-react-app` utility using `webpack`, `babel` and some other libs instead.

This version has more flexible and useful configuration for better development process (support jsx).

## Run

```sh
npm start
```

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```
